      <p>Java is class based object orientated programming language, where the code you write is designed to run 
        on all platforms that support java. The code must be compiled to run, and is compiled to byte code that can run on any JVM. 
        Java syntax is similar to c/c++. 
        The JVM works on three principles, 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write code - this is written in an IDE/text-editor, written by a human. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Compile code - compilation of code is done by <b>JAVAC</b>; included in JDK(java development kit); which takes Java program as input and outputs a bytecode.
          </li>
          <li>
            Execute code - In the running phase, the JVM executes this bytecode generated by the compiler.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Every operating system follows this process, essentially everything is run at bytecode level with their own JVM. Because of this, java is known as platform-independent language.
        <br>
        <br>
        For any java program to run, a computer must have a JRE(JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT); this won't compile the code, but it includes a browser, JVM, applet supports and plugs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Java has a built in program called Garbage Collector, where non referenced objects are collected. Rather than humans manually managing this, it is managed by the programmed. Where its main objective is to free heap memorby by destroying unreachable objects. 
        <br>
       <br>
       In Java, there are many libraries with useful framework which can be used to help build your programs. For this reason we have classpath, where java runtime and java compiler look for .class files to load. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
      </p>
      <code>import org.company.Menu </code>
      <p>This import statement makes the Menu class available to use in our current class, such that the Menu can be instantiated.</p>
    <code>Menu menu = new Menu() </code>
    <p>By importing, and specifying the full package, the JVM will know where to find Menu class, and be used in our code.</p>
