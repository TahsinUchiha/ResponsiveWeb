      <p>Java is class based object orientated programming language, where the code you write is designed to run 
        on all platforms that support java. The code must be compiled to run, and is compiled to byte code that can run on any JVM. 
        Java syntax is similar to c/c++. 
        The JVM works on three principles, 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write code - this is written in an IDE/text-editor, written by a human. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Compile code - compilation of code is done by <b>JAVAC</b>; included in JDK(java development kit); which takes Java program as input and outputs a bytecode.
          </li>
          <li>
            Execute code - In the running phase, the JVM executes this bytecode generated by the compiler.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Every operating system follows this process, essentially everything is run at bytecode level with their own JVM. Because of this, java is known as platform-independent language.
        <br>
        <br>
        For any java program to run, a computer must have a JRE(JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT); this won't compile the code, but it includes a browser, JVM, applet supports and plugs.
