        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Java is class based object orientated programming language, where the code you write is designed to run 
        on all platforms that support java. The code must be compiled to run, and is compiled to byte code that can run on any JVM. 
        Java syntax is similar to c/c++. 
        The JVM works on three principles, 
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write code - this is written in an IDE/text-editor, written by a human. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Compile code - compilation of code is done by <b>JAVAC</b>; included in JDK(java development kit); which takes Java program as input and outputs a bytecode.
          </li>
          <li>
            Execute code - In the running phase, the JVM executes this bytecode generated by the compiler.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Every operating system follows this process, essentially everything is run at bytecode level with their own JVM. Because of this, java is known as platform-independent language.
        <br>
        <br>
        For any java program to run, a computer must have a JRE(JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT); this won't compile the code, but it includes a browser, JVM, applet supports and plugs. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Java has a built in program called Garbage Collector, where non referenced objects are collected. Rather than humans manually managing this, it is managed by the programmed. Where its main objective is to free heap memorby by destroying unreachable objects. 
        <br>
       <br>
       In Java, there are many libraries with useful framework which can be used to help build your programs. For this reason we have classpath, where java runtime and java compiler look for .class files to load. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example,
      </p>
      <code id="small">import org.company.Menu </code>
      <p>This import statement makes the Menu class available to use in our current class, such that the Menu can be instantiated.</p>
    <code id="small">Menu menu = new Menu() </code>
    <p>By importing, and specifying the full package, the JVM will know where to find Menu class, and be used in our code.</p>

        <h1>What you should already know</h1>
      </header>
      <p>This guide is ideally aimed at those without any prior background knowledge in Java, but assumes the follow basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Assumes some knowledge in coding or programming experience, if you are entirely new to programming – try to follow, but further reading may require for clarifications. Please don’t be afraid of looking up any jargons used that you don’t understand. 
        </li>
        <li>This one’s key to any programming, you need to be good at using the internet and googling something you don’t understand.</li>
        <li>Basic problem solving thinking will help understand problems and come up with solutions. (There will be some examples, where I recommend you try to solve yourself before checking solutions)</li>

      <header>
        <h1>Java vs Javascript</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Though they share similar name, syntactically and someways sometimes similar, fundamentally they are very different. 
        JS(java script) resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        JS follows Java's expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason it was actually renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. 
      </p>
      <p>Java is not as free-form language as JS. In Java you must declare all variables, classes and methods. Methods also need to be declared either public, private or protected. Interfaces can also sometimes be implemented and often recommended. Variables, parameters and functions also need a return type explictly unlike in JS.</p>

      <header>
      <h1>Basic OOP Principles</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Java is an OOP Language, what this means is that it is an Object Orientated Programming language; where a program is in terms of a collection of objects, each of which is comprised of data and code. Where data is in the form of fields otherwise known as attributes or properties and code, in the form of 
        procedures also known as methods. In Java, these OOP objects are class based, where objects are instances of classes.
        In OOP, we have 4 main concepts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Abstraction</b> - Without delving too deep into the code, derived objects will only reveal necessary information required. If needed, functionality can be extended from these derived classes, allowing developers to make additions to functions or methods.  </li>
          <li><b>Encapsulation</b> - An object will have all information associated with it, contained within its class; similar to abstraction, only select information will be exposed. These implementations are privately held inside the defined class and other objects that don't have access to this class won't be able to modify or make changes. These objects will only be able to call functions or methods that are listed public. </li>
          <li><b>Inheritance</b> - This allows for classes to reuse codes from other classes. This allows developers to maintain a system of hierarchy, allowing for better reusability of code, lowering development time and reduces need for duplicates.</li>
          <li><b>Polymorphism</b> - Is the ability for an object to share similar behaviours to others. Based on parent class, the program will determine how the object will behave based on the </li>
        </ul>
      <p>Main benefits of OOP languages are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code reusability</li>
        <li>Scalability</li>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
      <header>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Due to the portability of Java, if you have JVM installed on one machine it can be run on another machine. 
        To write the most basic code, to know we have Java working in our machines. 
We will print out on console, <b>hello world</b>
      </p>
      <p></p>
<pre class="language-java"><code>
//Basic java hello world program to print "hello world"
//import modules/libraries required
  import java.io*
   
  // set up class 
  class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // prints Hello World
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
    
}
</pre></code>
<p> Let's break down what's happening, </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Comments</b> - first few lines are known as comments and used to explain the code, for this example we have commented for every new line, but for general practice, you don't need to comment for every single line. Good practice would be to comment at the start explaining what the code does, and comment the functionalities of any methods
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Import</b> - second line imports from java.io*, this is essentially importing all classes of the io package. This io package provides a set of input and output streams for reading/writing data files. We import classes to provide us with methods/functionalities to use within our code
  </li>
  <li> <b>Class</b> - The class contains the data and methods to be used in the program. Methods define the behaviour of a program, in this example we only have one method called <b>main</b>, which is <b>void</b>, meaning it does not request anything to be returned</li>
  <li> Within the main method, <code style="color: rgb(138, 138, 138);">System.out.println("Hello World")</code>, this calls the method println() from the standard output stream which prints whatever is within the method onto console. </li>
</ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>
      <h1>Variables</h1>
      </header>
      <p>In your application, variables are symbolic names for values and are essentially containers for storing data values</p>
      <ul>
        <p>Example we have:</p>
        <li>
          <b>String</b> - stores text, such as "Hello World", and are usually surrounded by double quotes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>int</b> - stores integers, such as <code style="color: rgb(219, 31, 31);">12</code>
        </li>
        <li><b>boolean</b> - stores either two states, <code  style="color: rgb(8, 245, 87);" >true</code> or <code  style="color: rgb(219, 31, 31);">false</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
      <header>
      <h1>Data Types</h1>
      </header>
      <p>In Standard Java there are 8 primitive data types <b>byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean</b> and <b>char</b> </p>
      <p>In Java, when we declare a variable, we must specify the valid data type before giving it a value</p>
      <p>Some examples below on data types and how to declare:</p>
      <pre class="language-java"><code>
int someNum = 10; // Integers - numbers that can only be whole number
double someDouble = 4.22; // Double - numbers that can be represented as decimal
char someLetter = 'A'; // Char - representing a letter
boolean someBool = true; // Boolean - representing either true or false
String someText = "Hello World"; // String - representing a chain of chars
      </code></pre>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
      <header>
      <h1>Variable Scope</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Scopes are the region where a certain variable is accessible within a region of the program.
        Depending on the location they are created, that variable is only accessible by a function or method after it has been declared. 
      </p>
      <p>In Java we have <b>local scope</b>, sometimes known as a method level scope where a variable is declared within a method or function and the variable is NOT accessible outside this method. A <b>global scope</b> or sometimes known as Class level scope, are variables declared within a class usually at the very top of the code execution block and is accessible to all methods within that class - depending on whether it is public or private it can even be accessed outside the class. A <b>Block scope</b> are sometimes declared in <code>for</code> loop condition and is not accessible after the loop is complete; unless defined seperately beforehand. </p>
      <p>Example of <b>Global Scope</b>:</p>
      <pre class="language-java"><code>
public class Animal {
  private int legs;
  public String type;

  public Animal(int legs, String type) {
    // Variable legs and type accessible here
  }
  
  public void fly(String type) {
    // Variable legs and type accessible here
  }

}

public class whatAnimal{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  Animal animalObj = new Animal(2, "Bird");
  // Can access the public variable type 
  String animalType = animalObj.type;
  
  // Can't access the private variable legs in this class
  // int animalLegs = animalObj.legs -- would result in an error
  }
}
      </code></pre>
